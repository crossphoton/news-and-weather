# NEWS and WEATHER APP

In this case I've used the fetch API to fetch data from the api but this can be achieved through an AJAX request too.

As usual API keys should be added to make the code functional.

## Fetching

weatherGet() and newsGet() functions make the GET request to the API with appropriate parameters.

## Quering

'change' event listeners are used to query the input.

Obviously the query can be modified by changing the URL used in fetch();

## Cursor

I changed the cursor because I like it in this way and it looks minimal.
